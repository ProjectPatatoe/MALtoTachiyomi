Get metadata and cover image for the manga reader, Tachayomi from MyAnimeList.

This currently uses the Jikan API to access MAL data because it doesn't require any checks.

Run the script, enter the ID number of the manga, and it will create the details.json and cover.jpg to 
place along with your manga files. If your manga has alot of authors/artists, it will take a while to generate the details.json. This is because there has to be a delay to not go over the limit in the Jikan API. Just be paitient (:
