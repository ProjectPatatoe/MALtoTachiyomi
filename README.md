NOTE: Probably won't update this anymore as I can't differentiate between Artist and Author anymore.

Get metadata and cover image for the manga reader, Tachayomi from MyAnimeList.

This currently uses the Jikan API to access MAL data because it doesn't require any logins.

Run the script, enter the ID number of the manga, and it will create the details.json and cover.jpg to 
place along with your manga files.

TODO:
* check for connection problems
* search?

Notes for future me:
* https://tachi-local.netlify.app/ - but this doesn't get cover.jpg
* https://github.com/anansi-project/comicinfo - another format supported by tachiyomi now. maybe more fitting for the metadata?
